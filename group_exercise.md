# Group Exercise

Now is your turn to create a RAG system from beginning to end!

## Instructions

1. I will provide 3 datasets to you, each with a sample research question.
2. You will coalesce in teams, each team will be assigned one of the 3 datasets (this may be flexible, depending on interest and number of people).
3. If you need or want to modify your question, that is fine! Just make sure the whole team is on board.
4. As a team, you must decide how to tackle that research question with your dataset and with your knowledge of RAG.
5. Build the RAG system from scratch, and present it as a tool for answering the research question.
6. We will stop at xx:xx. We will then present the final product and share any tips or challenges we encountered as a team.

## Team Notes
- Make sure everyone in your team has time and space to express themselves, and that all opinions and ideas are considered equally.
- Remember that some people speak softer, or with fewer words. Loudest is not always more valid!
- Strive for a 'flat' team structure. But if you want some organization, you can have 'facilitator' roles (I try to avoid the term 'leader', as it often results in counterproductive results for true innovation and team collaboration).
- Be flexible, be open, and have fun!

## Optional
- If you have an exciting dataset you want to try RAG on, and a research question accompanying it, feel free to propose a new group!
- You may want to experiment with other models for embedding or generation. For example, nomic-ai's embedding models are pretty popular, you can check others [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). Note that if you use other models you must consider a few extra things, for example size (some are a few GBs in size), security (they must be from trusted institutions, some will require to run extra code that you must trust), task specificity (you may need to add to your queries that you are doing semantic search, for example) and modality (are they for text, for images, for sound, multimodal?).
