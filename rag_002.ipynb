      "The reason why the sky appears blue, rather than pink or any other color, is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and interacts with tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sunlight consists of a spectrum of colors, each with its own wavelength.\n",
      "2. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gas, which scatter the shorter wavelengths of light more than the longer wavelengths.\n",
      "3. The shorter wavelengths, such as blue and violet, are scattered in all directions by the gas molecules.\n",
      "4. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance from our vantage point on the ground. The longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, are not scattered as much and continue to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes and appearing as the sun's surface color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, why isn't the sky pink? Well, there are a few reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pink light has a shorter wavelength than blue light, which means it is even more easily scattered by the gas molecules.\n",
      "2. The scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths, so blue and violet light dominate the sky's color.\n",
      "3. Additionally, the Earth's atmosphere contains relatively small amounts of gases that absorb or scatter longer wavelengths, such as pink and red.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: the combination of Rayleigh scattering, the distribution of gas molecules in the atmosphere, and the absorption/scattering properties of the air make the sky appear blue, rather than pink or any other color.\n"
